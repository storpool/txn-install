txn-install (0.2.1-1~1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version, update the upstream copyright years.
  * Fill in some debian/control and debian/upstream/metadata information.
  * Add a watch file and the upstream OpenPGP signing key.
  * Bring up to compliance with version 4.1.5 of the Debian policy:
    - drop the redundant "Testsuite: autopkgtest" source control field
  * Add "Rules-Requires-Root: no" and override the install(1) invocations,
    thereby also stopping the upstream build system from stripping
    the installed executable file so that a -dbgsym package may be created.
  * Add the Vcs-* source control fields.
  * Drop the dependency on the essential "diffutils" package.
